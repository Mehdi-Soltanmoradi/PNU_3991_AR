Guidelines for Syllabi

1- Basic information about the instructor and course. Instructor's full name and title, office location and telephone number, office hours, home telephone number (optional), e-mail address, and the like information concerning teaching assistant(s). Course title/number/credits, class meeting times and place, catalog description, prerequisites for the course, students for whom the course is intended. Since some of these items cannot be known until the course is actually scheduled, you might simply leave a space for them in the syllabus by putting the item in parentheses. Thus: (office hours).
2- Course purpose, goals, and objectives. Course rationale, general course goals, specific objectives, relationship of course to general education requirements, including its place in a sequence, relationship of course to institutional mission. Particularly necessary in this section is an articulation of how the course meets the Writing Intensive and/or Research Methods/Presentation Skills requirements. Be sure to consult those requirements' goals. We distinguish here between goals of the course (such as the kind of knowledge or skills students are invited to learn) and the objectives of the course (such as the specific subject matter or kind of exercise the students will engage in). The objectives are the means to the goals. It will be essential to spell out the relationship of the course's goals and objectives to the goals and objectives of the new General Education requirements and the Pepperdine Christian Mission, since a review of these matters is paramount in the charge of this Committee.
3- Content outline. Topic outline for course and sequencing of course content, rationale for course content and sequencing, definition of the discipline, the skills to be applied. By "definition of the discipline," we are asking whether the course is conceived primarily as teaching (for example) a mode of inquiry, a set of skills to be mastered, a set of skills to be applied, an interrelated set of interests and values, a set of objects or phenomena that humans have tried to explain, an organized body of knowledge, a set of interrelated concepts and operations.
4- Student assignments and purpose. Readings (with approximate page numbers), papers (number, length, general description), required documentation style (if any), tests/quizzes, projects, laboratories, clinics, field experiences. Also include relationship of assignments to course goals and objectives. The readings and due dates for papers, tests, etc. may be combined with the topic outline in a calendar for a hypothetical semester.
5- Textbooks. Title, author, edition, publisher. Include both required readings and recommended readings.
6- Methods of instruction. Description of and rationale for instructional techniques, description of class format (lecture, lecture/discussion, seminar, etc.).
7- Feedback to students. Grading system, including quizzes/tests, papers, attendance, class participation, questions. Include policies on assignments/tests/makeups, policies on attendance/incompletes.
8- Learning facilities and resources for students, for example writing laboratory.
